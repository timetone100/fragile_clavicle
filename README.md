# fragile_clavicle

Long time colaborators Brian Redmond and I decided to try a new project after a ten year hiadus. Partly thanks to the 2020 pandemic we decided to collaborate with a new set of limitations. 

## Colaboration

Just read the limitations and follow them. Use any DAW. Limitations usually include key, time signature, and some plugins and samples that are free and/or provided. 

We will eventually share these things with you!
